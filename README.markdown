============
ready.load.js â€” A light weight library to simplify and optimize your page load and functionality.
============
 
This two part library is designed to utilize jQuery but minimize the initial footprint for loading the site. Also take advantage of the streamlined HTML5 enabler, browser specific and viewport based classes, not to mention the automated polyfill. See the complete feature set below.
 
Features
============

*   Extremely Small load footprint. __Initial load is less than 1kb__.
*   Streamlined HTML5 shim for older browsers. Only what we use.
*   No javascript class for fallback CSS styles.
*   Browser specific CSS classes. (.webkit, .moz, .ie, .opera)
*   Predefined screen widtd based CSS classes. (.small, .medium, .large)
*   IE version classes. (.ie6, .ie7, etc.)
*   CSS class for usage with css3pie.com. (.pie) 
*   Utilize jQuery before its actually loaded.
*   Script loader simplify your use of additional plugins.
*   Automated and extendable polyfill feature to load additional scripts.
*   Automated Layout specific scripts are loaded utilizing metatags.
*   Simplified and very handy Google Analytics loader using metatags.

Usage
=====
 
Add the ready script to the &lt;head&gt; of your document.
 
    <script src="/scripts/ready.js"></script>
    
Then load jQuery and then the load script to the bottom of your document.

    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>!window.jQuery && document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src="/scripts/jquery.js"%3E%3C/script%3E'))</script>
    <script src="/scripts/load.js"></script>
  
Now anywhere on the page you can call the ready function and it will act just like jQuery.ready. This is great for template based websites where you need to provide customized functionality on a page but its not worth modifying your common scripts.

    ready(function($){
      $('a').hide();
    });
  
You can also do script loading as well. Add an additional scripts without modifying your footer.

    ready('/scripts/plugin.js',function($){
      $('a').plugin();
    });
    
The library also includes a streamlined HTML5 enabler for older browsers. It also provides numerous CSS class based references regards to browser and screen width. See the feature list about for the complete list.
 
Enjoy.
